# Multilinear_Regression_Model

Introduction to Multilinear Regression:

Multilinear regression, also known as multiple linear regression, is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. In contrast to simple linear regression, which involves only one independent variable, multilinear regression incorporates multiple predictors to better capture the complexity of real-world relationships.

Key Concepts:

1. **Dependent Variable (Y):**
   - The variable you want to predict or explain. It is influenced by one or more independent variables.

2. **Independent Variables (X):**
   - The variables that are used to predict the dependent variable. In multilinear regression, there are multiple independent variables.

3. **Linear Relationship:**
   - The model assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear. The coefficients represent the slope of this linear relationship.

4. **Regression Equation:**
   - The multilinear regression model is expressed through an equation:
     \[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_nX_n + \epsilon \]
     - \( Y \): Dependent variable
     - \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \): Independent variables
     - \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n \): Coefficients (intercept and slopes)
     - \( \epsilon \): Error term representing unobserved factors

5. **Coefficients:**
   - The coefficients (\( \beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n \)) indicate the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, considering other variables are held constant.

6. **Intercept (\( \beta_0 \)):**
   - Represents the predicted value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are set to zero.

7. **Assumptions:**
   - Multilinear regression assumes that the relationship is linear, errors are normally distributed, and there is no perfect multicollinearity among the independent variables.

8. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Common metrics for evaluating the performance of the model include Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (\( R^2 \)), and adjusted R-squared.
